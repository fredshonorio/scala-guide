<p>This document is a short guide in building backend services in Scala, using functional programming (FP), although a lot of ideas are applicable for other languages and different domains. It is the result of working for some years in a Java codebase, with a functional mindset. As such, a lot of parallels will be drawn between Java and Scala.</p>
<p>The motivating design principle is <strong>maintainability</strong>, meaning, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be easy to identify causes of errors</li>
<li>It should be easy to identify the responsibilities of a piece of code, enabling:
<ul>
<li>refactoring</li>
<li>replacing</li>
<li>adding features without impacting existing ones</li>
<li>remove it once it becomes unnecessary</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It should be easy to work on a system without a lot of cognitive load, e.g:
<ul>
<li>After a period of onboarding, it should be easy for a new developer to understand the structure of <em>every</em> service written in this manner</li>
<li>A developer that has not working on a service for a long time can quickly get up to speed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It should be easy to execute parts of the code, with either fake or real data and real, local or mocked dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to build correct systems (i.e.Â systems that work as specified/expected) that are not maintainable but that is obviously less desirable.</p>
